# Hulat-TaskAB at eHealth-KD Challenge 2019. Knowledge Recognition from Health Documents by BiLSTM-CRF.

System participating in the [eHealth-KD Challenge 2019](https://knowledge-learning.github.io/ehealthkd-2019/).

## Abstract

Currently, the number of electronic health documents is increasing exponentially. Due to this, there is a growing interest in developing automatic systems to extract interesting information from these texts.  In this paper, we describe a deep learning architecture for the identification and classification of named entities of interest in health documents. The architecture consists of two bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory layers and a final layer based on Conditional Random Fields. Our system (Hulat-TaskAB) participated in the ehealthkd-2019 sub-task A and obtained a micro-F1 of 76.63\%.
